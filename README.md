# Malware Analysis Project

### Incident alert:
Malware sample detected and flagged for analysis.

### Description
A suspicious malware binary has been identified, and detailed analysis is required to determine its type, infection vector, communication methods, and potential indicators of compromise (IOCs). This malware may exhibit spying, data exfiltration, encryption, or destructive behavior, which requires immediate action to understand its impact and prevent further damage.

### Required Tools

CyberChef: For analyzing file structure and content.
File/URL/IP reputation sites: To verify if the malware has been previously identified.
Virtualization Platform (VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V): For safe malware execution in an isolated environment.
Hex editors: To inspect the malware file in hexadecimal format.
Network monitoring tools: To observe C2C (command and control) communications.
Incident Categorization

### Severity: High
Type: Malware Infection, Data Exfiltration, Ransomware
Step-by-Step Instructions

### Set Up the Malware Lab (pre prepared):

### Self-hosted setup: 
Use a hypervisor (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware) with a properly configured VM. Ensure firewall and real-time protection are disabled, and no shared folders are enabled. The VM should be isolated from other networks (VLAN: host-only mode).
### Cloud-hosted setup: 
Utilize browser-based access tools like Kasm or Citrix DaaS for malware analysis.

## Static Analysis Workflow (CyberChef):

### Identify the file type:
Determine the target OS, architecture, and file signature by inspecting the file header (e.g., .dll, .exe).
### Generate a hash:
Create an MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 hash to check if the malware has been previously analyzed on threat intelligence platforms.
### Inspect PE headers:
The PE header starts at hex 50 45, indicating malware functionality. Look for the characteristic MZ signature (4D 5A).
### Analyze strings:
Use CyberChef to extract readable strings from the binary, which may give insights into its behavior (e.g., IP addresses, URLs). Be aware that attackers may use obfuscation and packing techniques to hide malicious content.
### Unpack & de-obfuscate:
If the file is packed, use CyberChef's unpacking tools to extract the original malware for analysis.

## Dynamic Analysis Workflow (File Reputation sites):
Note only if file is not confidetial

### Monitor execution in a controlled environment:
Run the malware within the isolated VM environment. Use debuggers and monitoring tools to observe its behavior, including file, registry changes, and network activity.
### Conduct Network Traffic Analysis:
Monitor network traffic to detect any command and control (C2C) communications. This will help identify whether the malware is attempting to communicate with external servers for data exfiltration or further instructions.
### Identify IOCs (Indicators of Compromise):

Extract IOCs from the static and dynamic analysis. These may include IP addresses, file hashes, domain names, and registry entries, which can be used for future detection.
Analyze Reputation Using External Sources:

Cross-reference the file’s hash with online reputation services like VirusTotal, abuse.ch, or others to determine whether the malware has been previously identified and analyzed.
Isolate and Investigate:

If the malware is confirmed to be malicious, isolate the affected system to prevent further infection or lateral movement within the network.
## Verification Steps

<ul>
  <li>Ensure that no further malicious activities or anomalies are detected in the system or network.</li>
  <li>Confirm that IOCs have been identified and shared with relevant teams for future prevention.</li>
<li>Review logs and reports to verify that the malware was successfully analyzed, and appropriate countermeasures were implemented.</li>
</ul>


## Collaboration Steps

### Incident Reporting:
Log all findings in your threat intelligence and incident management systems (e.g., Azure Sentinel). Include a comprehensive analysis of the malware, its functionality, and IOCs.
### Escalation:
If the malware is part of a broader attack, escalate the issue to the appropriate security teams for domain-wide remediation.
### Communication:
Inform relevant stakeholders, including the IT and security teams, of the findings, the malware’s capabilities, and any actions that need to be taken (e.g., patching, network segmentation).
